CS4550-Bento 
A Recipe Search Web Application

Bento is a web application that allows you to easily search for recipes without the popups/ads. With Bento, you must make an account to search for recipes. The sign-in process should be relatively simple. After joining, you can search for recipes, save recipes, update/edit your pantry ingredients, and more.

We have chosen to use the Spoonacular API for this project.
